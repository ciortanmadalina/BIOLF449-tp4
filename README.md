## INFOF434 

1. Go to biomart and download the last human genome
annotation, transcripts + genes + HGNC symbol
http://aug2014.archive.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/1b810dbe49f6727ce631a4d8aa203829

2. Compute the average number of transcript per gene
3. What is the maximum, minimum and average number of
transcripts per gene?
4. Plot the number of transcript per gene distribution (histogram)


1. Download from gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov all Thymus RNA-seq
HTSeq-Counts
2. Compute the FPKM and TPM for all samples
3. Draw a MA plot for the first 4 samples using the FPKM
4. Compute the FC, Log ratio and Pvalue by comparing the 10 first
samples vs the 10 last (MANIFEST table order)
5. Draw a volcano plot for the same groups (Pvalue using t-test)
6. Optional: Redo 5-8 using gene HUGO name instead of ENSG
TP4 part B
mail the report to madefran@ulb.ac.be before next course (9/11)
